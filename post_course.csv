One of the things that was mentioned was the fact that the voltmeter given was actually a multi-meter which can measure the current. One thing I suggest if you really want to carry on with the project for future classes is to provide an example of how you want us to conduct the experiment (e.g. there has a been confusion and even heated debate on whether the double batteries not only increases the voltage, but whether it does increase the current. This question has not been even answered during VIVA, which frustrates us.)) While I understand some of the L.Os provided guide us to a minimal effort, and the fact that these project is supposed to be very open-minded, we cannot be 100% sure that whatever we do is always right.) Moreover, not alot of us have the same electrochemistry and we all have different starting fields, the project is unfair as we feel that not everyone has the same starting background and therefore we have different assumptions. Examples includes whether the resistance of the batteries, as well as the wires, electrodes and electrolytes has to be assumed to 0 ohms or not. While maybe it was an intentional from your part to instill the ""group discussion"" for the project, I feel like there was NOT a satisfactory answer we get, especially at the end of the project. 

The hands-on tutorial, meanwhile, was short and we do not learn much from the 1 hour session, as much as the answers that were uploaded on LumiNUS. Attendance was not even compulsory. If the guided question provided from the hands-on tutorial was used as the guiding questions for the project, we feel that we could have learnt better that way.

Lastly, I feel like there should not be any 3 minute video editing component, as not everyone has video editing experience, which is very unfair. Some people may have access to better video editing software (like admittedly yours truly), but I do not find it fair as those freeware editing softwares have some functions that are limited nor behind a pay-wall. Also, the pro-forma and workload for the project does not strongly justify the amount of hours we spend. For a group of 3 consisting of Year 3 Chemistry Students, it is already very hard for us to meet up and conduct the experiments, even during the current pandemic as any of us could end up with Covid. Moreover, the pro-forma feels more like a report, which hence I would suggest if you expect us to type such a long answer, it should just be a group report like any other laboratory modules we took. The weightage of the group report should be the same as the VIVA, or moreover of a higher weightage due to the amount of time spend on it.",Please take note that the assessment of the project should account for the things I mentioned above.

The hands-on tutorial was a good first attempt to expose students to the real-life applications and concepts. However, there were too many factors and different experiments that was attempted to be sqeeuzed into a 1-hour tutorial timeslot, which in my opinion was not useful because we would be too focused on rushing through to appreciate the meaningfulness and concepts behind it all. Furthermore, I felt like the answers given after the tutorial were more useful in my understanding of the concepts and things that we were expected to know, becuase it gave us a benchmark to look at and what to expect for later learning.

I also understand that the project also came from the perspective to allow students to come up with their own questions that would be answered through doing the project as a means of self-discovery. However, I still feel that some guidance could have been included in the handout, such as asking certain guiding questions or questions to further probe student thinking. This is because the project assumes that everyone has the same basic level of understanding for electrochemistry, but granted that everyone comes from different backgrounds (i.e. JC, poly etc.), not everyone would be equally familiar with the concepts, and it feels like other groups might have advantage if they have members who are stronger in their concepts. As a result of such mixed abilities of group members in a group, I have heard that this has led to a lot of confusion and heated debates, because no one is unsure of what the correct concepts are. This has led to some unhappiness and second guessing, which could hamper our own understanding of the concepts that the professors intend for us to learn. As it was hard to get any clarification, this also made the viva especially challenging for many of us, as we were unable to even ascertain what we knew was the correct answers beforehand, and as such making us feel unprepared before viva. Furthermore, it was unfair to make students make a video to summarise what experiments we did, because not everyone would have the technical know-how or the relevant software and skills to make a (good) video.

In my opinion, it could have been more apt to make it more of a report to be written instead of calling it a pro forma, and the weightage of the report should be raised to match that of the viva. It might have also been better to scrap the making of the video, but instead include what experiments were run and methodology into the report itself. This would mean that both the extended pro forma (now lab report) and the viva would each constitute 10% of the grade.",NIL

Project: More equipment should be provided as additional resource, e.g. wooden splint and lighter for testing for oxygen and hydrogen gas, litmus paper for testing for the possible evolution of acidic/basic/ gases which may let students test for and observe and document more useful information from their experiments, rather than based on purely observational skills of natural phenomena. This may reduce the gap of unfairness for other project groups that are more self-resourceful where they may access these materials to allow them to make new observations and give them an edge in making the more correct conclusions, less accessible to those who do not have said resources. 

Project experimental manual while it should state parameters to examine, it should include an additional line where students should critically examine all of the effects a given material could produce. This should aid students think beyond the box, as many students I believe had thoroughly mistaken that the experiment was a simple experiment bound by the lab manual instructions and parameters.",-

Only feedback to give is that not many students understand circuitry, so perhaps a primer on basic circuitry(battergy set-up etc) should be included as an appendix of a lecture or handout. 

The hands-on-tutorial was too short of a duration, perhaps a longer period would allow for a better experience. (1hr is too short)

As we were still adjusting to our timetable and lectures in the first few weeks of school, it was tough to absorb all the content and understand the concepts behind electrochemistry after only watching the first lecture. As for the project, it was a little too time-consuming and the weightage does not reflect the effort being put into doing it. We felt that ImageJ was also not the best software as there were some assumptions that had to be made when doing and compiling the experimental results, which resulted in some of us not being able to explain certain results confidently. Overall, I think the instructions for the project can be made clearer and marking rubrics can also be given to the students to have a better understanding of how the project will be graded. Also, I feel like the video component can be removed as it takes up quite a bit of time and effort to only achieve 3% of the total weightage for the project.
